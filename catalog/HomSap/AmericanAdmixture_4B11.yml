description: Demographic model for American admixture, taken from Browning et al.
  2018. This model extends the Gravel et al. (2011) model of African/European/Asian
  demographic history to simulate an admixed population with admixture occurring 12
  generations ago. The admixed population had an initial size of 30,000 and grew at
  a rate of 5% per generation, with 1/6 of the population of African ancestry, 1/3
  European, and 1/2 Asian. Note that this demographic model was not inferred, and
  the mutation rate that Browning et al. used for simulation is smaller than used
  for inferring the model, so the mutation rate provided here is that from Gravel
  et al.
