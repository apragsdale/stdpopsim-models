description: 'This is the best-fitting model of a history of multiple ancient and
  present-day human populations sampled across Eurasia over the past 120,000 years.
  The fitting was performed using momi2 (Kamm et al. 2019), which uses the multi-population
  site-frequency spectrum as input data. The model includes a ghost admixture event
  (from unsampled basal Eurasians into early European farmers), and two admixture
  events where the source is approximately well-known (from Neanderthals into Non-Africans
  and from Western European hunter-gatherers into modern Sardinians. There are three
  present-day populations: Sardinians, Han Chinese and African Mbuti. Additionally,
  there are several ancient samples obtained from fossils dated at different times
  in the past: the Altai Neanderthal (Prufer et al. 2014), a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer
  (Lazaridis et al. 2014), a Neolithic early European sample (Lazaridis et al. 2014),
  and two Palaeolithic modern humans from Siberia - MA1 (Raghavan et al. 2014) and  Ust''Ishim
  (Fu et al. 2014). All the ancient samples are represented by a single diploid genome.'
