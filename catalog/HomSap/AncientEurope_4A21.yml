description: Population structure that has existed over the last 45,000 years in Europe,
  leading to modern Europeans. The model demonstrates the divergence of a Basal European
  Lineages into four ancient populations; Western, Eastern and Caucasus Hunter- Gatherers
  and Anatolian Farmers. Migration of Anatolian farmers into Western Europe and admixture
  with Western Hunter-Gatherers produces the European Neolithic Farmers. In West Asia
  the admixture of Eastern Hunter-Gatherers and Caucasus Hunter- Gatherers leads to
  the formation of the Yamnaya Steppe population. The Yamnaya migrate into Western
  Europe to admixture with the Neolithic farmers giving rise to Bronze Age europeans.
  There is only an exponential growth in population size from then to the Present-day.
  Samples are taken at multiple point throughout history from each population.
