description: Demographic model for a four population out-of-Africa history, taken
  from Jouganous et al. (2017). Parameter values were taken from table 4 in the main
  text. This model was fit based on joint allele frequecy spectrum (AFS) data from
  1000 Genomes exomes from the YRI, CEU, CHB, and JPT poulation samples. The demography
  follows the previous three-populations out-of-Africa models with an additional population
  split in Asia leading to the Japanese (JPT) population. Parameter values were estimated
  with the program Moments assuming a mutation rate of 1.44e-8 and a generation time
  of 29 years.
